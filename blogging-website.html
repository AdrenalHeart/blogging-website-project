    <h1>Dead by Daylight</h1>

    <p>The Fundamentals</p>

    <div class="important">
      <h2>Survivors</h2>
      <p>
        Survivors, alone, make up 50% of the game. There is a vast majority of characters, whom each have a unique set of perks, that contribute to the game's unpredictability. In every trial, the game sets 4 players against a killer. Their objective is to repair a total of 5 generators to power up the exit gates and potentially escape the trial. Thus hurdling the players into an intense, dramatic game of Chess.
      </p>

      <h2>Killers</h2>
      <p>
        Killers, just like Survivors, make up the other 50% of the game. There are many different characters to choose between. Similar to their survivor counterpart, killers have a unique set of perks and to each, their own specific ability. The killer's abilities can fit anyone's playstyle, whether it be Phasing, Cloaking, or Blinking; more on that later. The killer's objective is to prevent the survivors from repairing the generators and escaping the trial.
